def read_file_build_graph(file_name: str):
    '''
        The read file and build graph function does exactly that. It reads in
        the file containing the graph input and creates the graph.

        The input file cointains a graph in modified DIMACS format, where the
        first line has the total number of vertices and edges and the rest of
        the lines have two values, both vertices representing an edge between
        them.

        Input:
            file_name (str): name of the input file
        Returns:
            graph (2d arr): 2d array representing the graph as an adjacency lst
